# SharpBuzz

## REPL DEMO - Just Hit 'Run'
**https://repl.it/@Kharouk/SharpBuzz**

### Why C#?
I was always interested in the Unity Engine and want to get into game development at some point in my career. I thought that my version of FizzBuzz would be a great entry for me to grow comfortable with the basics of the languages.

Before C#, I solved FizzBuzz in Java and found the process very similar. Whether I'm importing ArrayList or List just to get an array, or I want to display to the console using the Main class I felt more comfortable with C# than I thought thanks to previous experience. 

### Next Challenge?
Now that I know a bit about the basics, I hope to read the documentations/follow some tutorials in C# so I can begin exploring the Unity engine.
